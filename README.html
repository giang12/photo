<h1>Slideshow of photos from different sources</h1>

<p>Side Project I started from the desire of having &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; photos slideshow on my TV while I&rsquo;m stuyding instead of just looking at those dull images from chromecast</p>

<h1>TO DO:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Add Comments damnit so you know what&rsquo;s going on after 2 months, instead of having to reread the entire application you monkey</li>
<li>Add auto push from github to stage</li>
<li>Dynamic Like Button -> on it</li>
<li>Fix removeFrom function (<em> _currPhotoPointer </em>)</li>
<li>Hide UI Controller (next, prev button, etc) if mouse doesnt move for more than X threshhold seconds</li>
<li>Authentication System -> facebook auth</li>
<li>Add In App Chromecast instead of releying on the tab-casting so we can cast from mobile</li>
<li>Nice UI Notification System instead of just console.log(&ldquo;monkey loves bananas&rdquo;) -> https://github.com/mouse0270/bootstrap-growl</li>
<li>Add more PhotoCollectors (reddit, imgur, tumblr,etc ?)</li>
<li>Add more TO DO</li>
</ul>
