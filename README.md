Slideshow of photos from different sources
=====
Side Project I started from the desire of having "pretty" photos slideshow on my TV while I'm stuyding instead of just looking at those dull images from chromecast

TO DO:
=====
* Add Comments damnit so you know what's going on after 2 months, instead of having to reread the entire application you monkey
* Dynamic Like Button -> on it
* Fix removeFrom function (* _currPhotoPointer *)
* Hide UI Controller (next, prev button, etc) if mouse doesnt move for more than X threshhold seconds
* Authentication System -> facebook auth
* Add In App Chromecast instead of releying on the tab-casting so we can cast from mobile
* Nice UI Notification System instead of just console.log("monkey loves bananas") -> https://github.com/mouse0270/bootstrap-growl
* Add more PhotoCollectors (reddit, imgur, tumblr,etc ?)
* Add more TO DO
